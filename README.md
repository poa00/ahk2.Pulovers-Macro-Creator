# Pulovers Macro Recorder for AHKv2
A modified version of Pulover's Macro Recorder for AHKv2

I'll be adding more details here soon.

- Auto-GUI-v2 credit to Mr. Pulover and all the credited creators listed here: https://github.com/Pulover/PuloversMacroCreator
  (will enumerate all credits soon)

- AHKv2converter credit to mmikeww and his team https://github.com/mmikeww/AHK-v2-script-converter

I did very little work weaving these two solutions together when looking at the years it took to curate the solutions by the creators just mentioned. 

# How it works 
- this runs Pulover on ahkv1
- Conversion happens in IDE, saving the code output hasn't been tested but will be. 
- function-call converts to v2 with ahkv2converter 
- autogui has custom code posted in the changes_of_note folder
- works with embedded ahk exe's from ahkconverter, you do not need ahkv1 or v2, hypothetically this should run portably
